								I work to characterize planets beyond our Solar System and understand the connection between them and their host star. My research involves data taken from many different instruments and telescopes and utlizes machine learning to efficiently expand our knowledge of extrasolar systems in an effort to shed light on the planet-star connection.

							<p>In July 2022 my collaborators and I published a research note reporting chemical abundances for 25 stars that JWST will observe in its first year. These are some figures that help visualize our results. Errorbars are representative of the average uncertainty. JWST targets are overlayed on a density map of my sample of ~4,500 stars for which I have determined abundances using KeckSpec, an implementation of the Cannon. These abundances will be released in a forthcoming catalog. </p> <br>

							<p>How much does a planet weigh? Or, more precisely, how <i>massive</i> are exoplanets? <br> The answer to this question is crucial to give us insight on what a planet may be made of but 
								a planet's mass cannot be measured from a <i>K2</i> or TESS lightcurve alone. </p>
							<p>As a member of the TESS-Keck Survey, I regularly use the High Resolution Spectrometer (HIRES) at Keck Observatory to measure the radial velocity signal of stars from which we derive the mass of a companion planet. As a result, I have contributed to 
							the detection and characterization of multiple exoplanets.</p>
							
							<h3 class="major">Wolf 503b</h3>
							<p>The subject of my first primary-author paper was the mass determination of a sub-Neptune known as Wolf 503b. I collaborated with scientists of 9 nationalities using over one hundred radial velocity measurements from not only Keck/HIRES but also PFS, CARMENES, and HARPS-N.
							My work determined this 2 Earth radius planet to have a mass of 6.2 Earth masses opening the possibility of Wolf 503b have a substantial (~50%) water mass fraction or a respectably sized envelope of hydrogen/helium.</p>

							<h2 class="major">Follow-up with Spitzer</h2>
							<span class="image main">
								<img src="images/spitzer.png" alt=""/>
							</span>
							<p>The <i>Spitzer</i> space telescope was never meant to study exoplanets but, with some creative analysis of its sensor at the sub-pixel level, it served as an important tool for exoplanet follow up until its retirement in January 2020. I work with transit data
							acquired by the Infared Array Camera (IRAC) typically at a wavelenth of 4.5 microns. Uncertainties in orbital parameters grow linearly with time so your confidence in when a planet will next transit its star decreases as time goes on. Not only is a transit recovery 
							from <i>Spitzer</i> important in confirming the existence of a planet (beyond a <i>Kepler</i> or TESS detection) but it also
							constrains the period of the orbit allowing us to make more accurate predictions of transit events for future investigations.  </p>

							<p>I am one of the founding organizers of Astro Nights at the University of Kansas. Every second Thursday of the month we host a talk from one of our faculty or graduate students followed by a chance for the public to see the cosmos up close with one of the department telescopes. We currently have four 8 inch Cassegrain reflectors but the star of the show is the 14 inch Dobsonian donated to our department (allegedly signed by John Dobson himself).</p> <br>
							<span class="image right"><img src="images/astro_night_help.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Before Astro Nights, there was no regular outreach effort. The telescopes were scattered throughout the building until I was able to secure a dedicated room for their proper storage. Now since November 2021, we've been able to attract on average 50 visitors for each event and bring the universe just a little closer to the people of Lawrence. </p> <br>
							<p>Along with a talk each month, we also plan to use the ExoLab's new inflatable planetarium to host immersive presentations taking the audience from the surface of Mars to far away galaxies. This planetarium packs a large punch in small space. It's large enough to seat 20 people but packs down into large suitcase opening the opportunity to give planetarium shows throughout Kansas. </p>
